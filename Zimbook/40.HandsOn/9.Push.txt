===== Push all =====

# ===== push all
GitBares=/virt/HandsOn
GitWorks=/virt/HandsOn

cd $GitWorks/usr1       # repo from where to push
git checkout master     # current branch is not involved, has no effect

git push --tags $GitBares/bare1.git  study.1:a/b/study.6

===== Check results =====
	* [[file:///usr/share/doc/git-doc/git-ls-remote.html|man git ls-remote]] 	# List branches and tags available in a **(local or) remote** repository.
	* **Note**: 				# ''git ls-remote'' works __anywhere__, for **any repo** and  __outside__ of **any repo**
	* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15472107/when-listing-git-ls-remote-why-theres-after-the-tag-name
		# article about why annotated tags are **listed twice**, with and without an **appended** "''^{}''".
		# Annotated tags have their own sha tag object, which refer to some commit.
		# the commit and the tag object (with appended ''^{}'') are listed.
		# you may want to grep the pattern ''^{}'' away.

==== ls-remote works also locally ====
	* The command ''git ls-remote'' works for any repository.
	* You may want to verify your own studies on local repositories also with this method.

===== Notes =====
	* If some existing remote branch is updated, there must be a **shared history**. This **may fail**.
	* If some new branch is pushed which does not exist on the remote, it will be created. This **never fails**.
	* For __testing different syntax variants__ you may push many new branches to remote.
	* And, you always can delete remote branches when you are done.
	* Push variants, show them, study them
