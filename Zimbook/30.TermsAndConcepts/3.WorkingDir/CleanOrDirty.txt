====== CleanOrDirty ======
Created Friday 23 October 2015

===== About =====
	* When is a working directory dirty?
	* The truth is needed at stashing.
		http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing


===== Definition 1 (somewhat wrong) =====
	* https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html#def_dirty
		# A working tree is said to be **dirty** if it contains modifications which have not been committed to the current branch.


===== Definition 2 (more wrong) =====
	* http://www.gitguys.com/topics/glossary/
		# **Dirty working directory**
		# If files have been updated in the working directory after they were updated in the index then the working directory is considered **dirty**. The working directory is **clean** if all modified files in the working directory have been added to the index.


===== Solution, summary =====
	* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20642980/does-git-dirty-mean-files-not-staged-or-not-committed-glossary-conflict
	* It is reasonable to ask **separately:**
		a) whether the __index__ is clean, meaning there is nothing staged for commit and/or
		b) the __working tree__ is clean, meaning unchanged with respect to __index__ and/or
		c) the __working tree__ is clean, meaning unchanged with respect to the __last commit__ (HEAD).
	* After all your __working tree__ is **clean** if 
		a) there are no changes with respect to the **last commit** (HEAD) and
		b) there also are no changes with respect to the **index**.
	* What ''git status'' tells you is both:
		# the answer to "what, if anything, is staged for commit" and 
		# "what, if anything, is different between the working tree and the index".
