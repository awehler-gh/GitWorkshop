Created Tuesday 15 December 2015

===== About =====
	* **[GitBook]** p. 150
	* **Pushing** a branch means 
		* to get the branch's **head ref** from a remote repository,
		* find out if it is a **direct ancestor** to the branch's **local head ref**, and **in that case**, 
		* **put** all **objects**, which are reachable from the local head ref, and which are missing from the remote repository, into the remote object database, and 
		* **update** the locally stored (mirrored) remote head ref.
	* **If** the remote head is **not an ancestor** to the local head, the push fails.


===== Essential facts =====
	* You can only push a **change** to a **remote repository** which results in a **fast-forward merge**.
	* You can (by default, with good reason) only push to **bare repositories**.
	* The **roles** of **push** and **fetch** may be **swapped**, if needed. 
		Think of ''scp'', you decide where to log in, local or remote.
		But anyway, the finally needed merge must be a **fast-forward merge**, because on the **bare** repository there is no Working Directory.
