Created Friday 27 November 2015

===== Create a bare repository =====
	{{./pasted_image.png}}
	* **[HackGuide]** __Remotes__
	* Notice how rather than creating a ''.git'' directory for the repository, ''git init --bare'' simply treats the current directory as the ''.git'' directory.
	* There's really not much to this repository. The only interesting things it contains are a ''HEAD'' reference which points to the ''master'' branch (which doesn't exist yet), and a config file which has the bare flag set to true. The other files aren't of much interest to us.

===== Variant =====
'''
# ===== create a new bare repository /tmp/kuckuck.git
git init --bare /tmp/kuckuck.git
#..

	{{/Icons/Warning.1.svg?height=24&type=None}} **Caution**
	* {{/Icons/led-green.gif}} If this directory does **not exist**, it is **created**. Good.
	* {{/Icons/led-yellow.gif}} If this directory **exists** and contains **ordinary** files and directories, you are **not warned** about this fact, existent files are just **retained**. This is probably **not what you want**, after all a bare repository does not have a Working Directory.
	* {{/Icons/led-red.gif}} If this directory **exists** and contains a valid **local git repository**, it nevertheless just is initialized with the result of a **nested repository**, what ever that means.
	* {{/Icons/led-green.gif}} If this directory **exists** and contains a valid **git bare repository**, say a repository of the same type, it also is re-initialized, but this is safe as mentioned by the documentation.

			# Running git init in an existing repository is **safe**. It will not overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for rerunning git init is to pick up newly added **templates** (or to move the repository to another place if --separate-git-dir is given).
