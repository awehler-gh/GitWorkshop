===== About =====
	* **[HackGuide]** __Cloning__ 
	* The git clone command is really just a **shortcut** which does a few things for you. With its default configuration, it will:
		* **Create** remote-tracking branches for each branch in the remote.
		* **Check out** the branch which is **currently active** (''HEAD'') on the remote.
		* Perform a git **pull** to bring the current branch and working tree up-to-date with the remote.
	* The command ''git clone'' takes a **URL** and supports a number of transport protocols including HTTP, SSH, and Gitâ€™s own protocol. It also supports plain old file paths, which is what we'll use.

	* First, it contains a **remote listing** for ''origin'', which is the **default name** given to a repository's main remote. This tells Git the **URL** of the **repository**, and which references it should retrieve when performing a ''git fetch''.
	* Below that is a **branch listing**. This is the configuration for a **remote-tracking branch**.
