===== About =====
	* The Git **working directory** is the directory that holds the **current checkout** of the files and subdirectories, recursively. These files are ready to be worked on.
		**[GitBook]** p. 17,  http://www.gitguys.com/topics/glossary#working
	* The terms **working directory** and **working tree** are synonyms, they mean the same.
	* **Tracked** files in the working directory are often **removed** or **replaced** by git as you **switch branches**.
	* **Untracked** files are **ignored** by git, except they are mentioned with git status.
		# Therefore, __untracked files__ are __not addressed__ with the term **working directory**.


===== States of a file in working tree =====
	* **untracked**
		# git does know nothing about the file __name__ in working directory.
	* **tracked**
		# committed with history and not staged
		# __contents__ for the named file in the working tree still matches the last commit
	* **staged** (registered to be commited)
		# git has registered a new or existing different **blob** for changed __contents__ 
		# which has to be committed the next time.
		# **Note: **Nothing is said about the current file __contents__ in the working tree.
		# It is the previously **staged blob** that will go into the next commit even if
		# another change happens later that would **need a new blob**.
		# Any change that shall be committed must be added with ''git add''.
	* **dirty** / modified
		# the file __contents__ differs from HEAD or it differs from Stage.
		# See discussion of **clean** or **dirty**: [[+CleanOrDirty]]


===== Example =====
	* **[GitPro]** p. 48

**Important:**
	# ''CONTRIBUTING.md'' is listed as both **staged** and **unstaged**. How is that possible? 
	It turns out that Git **stages** a file exactly as it is when you run the **git add** command. The staged version will be commited, even if the file has changed again in the meantime, which then is __not staged for commit__.
