====== 4.Tag ======
Created Monday 12 October 2015

===== About =====
	* A **tag object** is a **pointer** to a **commit**.
	* A tag gives a commit a **friendlier name** and remembers also a **message** and **timestamp**.
	* The **sha1 name** of a **tag object** is calculated from its **tag contents** including **meta data**:
		* **commit sha**, the **destination** where the tag points to.
		* **tagger**, who created this tag.
		* tag creation **timestamp**
		* tag **message**
	* **Note**: A tag is like a branch reference (about branches: see below) that **never moves**.


===== Tag: no checkout =====
	You can't really **checkout** a **tag** in Git, since it is fixed and there is no complementing checkin. 
	If you want to put a version of your repository in your working directory that looks like a specific tag, you can create a **new branch** at a specific tag with
'''
# ===== git checkout -b [branchname] [tagname]
$ git checkout -b version2  v2.0.0
Switched to a new branch 'version2'
#..
'''
	Of course if you do this and do a commit, your ''version2'' **branch** will differ from your v2.0.0 **tag** since it will move forward with your new changes as expected.

===== Lightweight tags =====
	* Note that git tag can also be used to create **lightweight tags**, which are not tag objects at all, but just simple **references** whose names begin with **refs/tags/**
