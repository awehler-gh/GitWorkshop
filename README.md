# If you cloned the repopsitory this way:
git clone https://github.com/awehler-gh/GitWorkshop /tmp/GitWorkshop

# ===== then edit: /tmp/GitWorkshop/Zimbook/notebook.zim
# set document_root, in this example to:
# document_root=/tmp/GitWorkshop

# =====  start zim with Zimbook, enjoy:
zim /tmp/GitWorkshop/Zimbook


# Watch out for changes here from time to time.
